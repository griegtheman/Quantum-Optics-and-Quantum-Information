Eduard is a Researcher at the Russian-Armenian University. He is currently pursuing
his Ph.D. degree in the Department of General Physics and Quantum Nanostructures
with a specialization in quantum optics and optical electronics research in the
specialization of Quantum Optics and Photonics. His thesis investigates the linear and
nonlinear properties of semiconductor quantum nanostructures with non-trivial
geometries and quantum dots as platforms for quantum information, quantum optics,
and nanoscale devices.
